# Project # 1 - Extract handwritten text using the REST API and Python in Computer Vision

# Prerequisites
- You must have Python installed if you want to run the sample locally.
- You must have a subscription key for Computer Vision. To get a subscription key, see Obtaining Subscription Keys.
Create and run the sample

# To create and run the sample, do the following steps:

- Copy the following code into a text editor.
- Make the following changes in code where needed:
- Replace the value of subscription_key with your subscription key.
- Replace the value of vision_base_url with the endpoint URL for the Computer Vision resource in the Azure region where you obtained your subscription keys, if necessary.
- Optionally, replace the value of image_url with the URL of a different image from which you want to extract handwritten text.
- Save the code as a file with an .py extension. For example, get-handwritten-text.py.
- Open a command prompt window.
- At the prompt, use the python command to run the sample. For example, python get-handwritten-text.py
